# midisynthesis
Our project, titled “Air Piano Using MIDI Synthesis of D Chords,” is a simple web-based application that lets users play piano sounds using their computer keyboard. It does not require a real piano or any musical instrument. Instead, it uses the Web MIDI API, which allows web browsers to produce musical sounds.
